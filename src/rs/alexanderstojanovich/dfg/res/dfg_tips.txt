For designation and proper use -  
name your font file accordingly. 
If you use Byte Map Font, examples are:
<html><b>"confont.bmf"</b> is for console font,</html>
<html><b>"smallfnt.bmf"</b> is for small font for chat,</html>
<html><b>"dbigfont.bmf"</b> is for big Doom font found in menus.</html>

Recommended is to choose spacing greater than zero. 

When uncertain "6-bit RGB" and "8-bit RGB" color palettes
are good choice for all games overall.

Game you make font for (Doom, Heretic or Hexen) should match
palette you've chosen.

Choosing "None" for palette and going for many colors in the font
may result in bad font which could have palette overflow.
Use designated game palette instead.

<html><b>Keep in mind that only small set of fonts can be synthesized and</b></html> 
<html><b>even smaller subset will look good in the game.</b></html>
