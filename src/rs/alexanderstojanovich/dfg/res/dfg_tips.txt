For designation and proper use -  
name your font file accordingly. 
If you use Byte Map Font, examples are:
<html><b>"confont.bmf"</b> is for console font,</html>
<html><b>"smallfnt.bmf"</b> is for small font for chat,</html>
<html><b>"dbigfont.bmf"</b> is for big Doom font found in menus.</html>
If you choose to use Lump, filenames are the same but with the .lmp extension.

Recommended is to choose spacing greater than zero. 
Otherwise characters will overlap when sampling.

Cell size multiplier is useful when characters are cut out because
of special effects like outline.

When uncertain "6-bit RGB" and "8-bit RGB" color palettes
are good choice for all games overall.

Game you make font for (Doom, Heretic or Hexen) should match
palette you've chosen.

Program always choose minimal subset of initial designated palette.

Program always go for minimal deviation approximation 
when dealing with lot of colors.

Program always holds one loaded font and one font ready for creation!

<html><b>Keep in mind that only small set of fonts can be synthesized and</b></html> 
<html><b>even smaller subset will look good in the game.</b></html>
