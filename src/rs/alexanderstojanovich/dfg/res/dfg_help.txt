<html><b>- TWO MODES OF THE PROGRAM</b></html>
<html><b>1. LOAD EXISTING DOOM FONT (VIEWER)</b></html>
    which opens any Doom Lump Font (.lmp) or Byte Map Font (.bmf),
    shows font format in Format section and previews them in the Image section.
    Byte Map Font info is displayed in text field Info
    of the Font section.
    Palette is displayed in the Effects section.	
    User can test the Font output by typing in text field Test.
    To refresh the image hitting enter is required.

<html><b>2. CREATE FROM PREEXISTING FONT (CREATOR)</b></html>
    which creates font (.bmf) file
    from preexisting installed font on your OS.
    Many features are available to the user, including:
    - Installed Font as a base,
    - Character range,
    - Colors,
    - Palette,
    - Additional effects (gradient, outline and anti-aliasing),
    - Font Info (optional for BMF fonts).
    When using this mode borders around characters are present.
    Those borders are an auxiliary overlay which won't be stored in targeted file.

<html><b>- COMMON</b></html>
    In both modes user can select whether or not 
    transparency is displayed. This however doesn't affect the targeted file,
    whether it is loaded or it's in creation.

<html><b>- FILE MANIPULATION</b><html>
    Any Doom Font (.lmp or .bmf) file can be Opened at any time
    and program is automatically set to VIEW ONLY 
    disabling most of the features for creating fonts.

    Any font (.lmp or .bmf) file can be Saved at any time
    and program retains it's mode allowing user to 
    save loaded under VIEWER mode or 
    change preferences and save again under CREATOR mode.
